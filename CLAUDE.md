# HubDownloader - General Purpose Video Downloader

## Project Overview
A web application that extracts direct video URLs from various sources (CDN links and HTML-embedded videos) and provides download links without storing videos on our server. Now supports YouTube, adult sites (PornHub, etc.), and general video extraction with HLS/DASH streaming support.

## Tech Stack
- **Full Stack**: Next.js 14 with App Router (TypeScript)
- **Backend API**: Next.js API Routes
- **URL Extraction**: Puppeteer for dynamic content
- **Video Processing**: yt-dlp and ffmpeg for HLS/DASH streams
- **Client-side**: Video URL detection scripts
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: SQLite via Prisma (for analytics, extraction history)
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Ad Integration**: Google AdSense (prepared)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 (prepared)

## Core Features

### 1. Video URL Extraction
- **Direct CDN Links**: Detect .mp4, .webm, .m3u8 (HLS), .mpd (DASH)
- **HTML Embedded Videos**: Extract from HTML5 video tags, iframe embeds
- **Dynamic Content**: Use headless browser to capture dynamically loaded videos
- **Multi-quality Detection**: Find all available quality URLs
- **Direct Download Links**: Provide direct URLs to users for downloading

### 2. Supported Formats
- Direct video files (MP4, WebM, AVI, MOV)
- HLS Streams (.m3u8)
- DASH Streams (.mpd)
- Progressive HTTP downloads
- Blob URLs (with limitations)

### 3. User Interface
- Clean, modern design
- Paste URL input field
- Loading indicator while extracting URLs
- Display extracted video URLs with quality options
- One-click download buttons
- Copy URL to clipboard option
- Recent extractions history

### 4. Monetization
- Strategic ad placement (header, sidebar, between results)
- Non-intrusive ad experience
- Premium tier (ad-free, higher limits)

### 5. SEO Strategy
- Server-side rendering with Next.js App Router
- Structured data (Schema.org)
- Dynamic sitemap generation
- Meta tags optimization with Next.js metadata API
- Fast Core Web Vitals
- Mobile-first design
- Dynamic OG images for social sharing

## Technical Architecture

### API Routes (Next.js App Router)
```
POST /api/extract - Extract video URLs from a webpage
GET /api/proxy/[...url] - Optional proxy for CORS-blocked videos
POST /api/analytics - Track successful extractions
GET /api/history - Get user's extraction history
```

### Page Routes (SSR)
```
/ - Homepage with URL input form
/extract/[id] - Results page showing extracted URLs
/history - User's extraction history
/how-to - Tutorial pages (SEO)
/about - About page (SEO)
/faq - Frequently asked questions (SEO)
```

### URL Extraction Pipeline
1. **Page Load**: Load target page with Puppeteer/Playwright
2. **Network Monitoring**: Capture all network requests for video files
3. **DOM Analysis**: Parse HTML5 video/source tags
4. **JavaScript Execution**: Wait for dynamic content to load
5. **URL Collection**: Aggregate all found video URLs
6. **Response**: Return list of direct video URLs to client

### Security Considerations
- Rate limiting per IP (10 requests/minute)
- URL validation and sanitization
- Timeout for page loading (30 seconds max)
- Memory limits for headless browser
- No execution of untrusted scripts
- SQLite for analytics only (no sensitive data)
- Regular browser instance recycling

## Known Issues & Solutions

### HLS Download Issues
- **HMAC Authentication Errors**: Some sites use time-based tokens. Use yt-dlp for better handling

- **Conversion Failures**: Ensure ffmpeg is installed and up to date

### YouTube Extraction
- YouTube URLs are best handled with yt-dlp installed
- Falls back to HLS stream detection via Puppeteer
- Quality is detected from itag parameters in URLs

### Development Notes
- Run with `npm run dev` for hot reload
- Check browser console for extraction debug logs
- Database file is at `prisma/dev.db`
- Logs show extraction flow: YouTube â†’ Adult â†’ Puppeteer
