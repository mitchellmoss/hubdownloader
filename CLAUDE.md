## Technical Architecture

### API Routes (Next.js App Router)
```
POST /api/extract - Extract video URLs from a webpage
GET /api/proxy/[...url] - Optional proxy for CORS-blocked videos
POST /api/analytics - Track successful extractions
GET /api/history - Get user's extraction history
```

### Page Routes (SSR)
```
/ - Homepage with URL input form
/extract/[id] - Results page showing extracted URLs
/history - User's extraction history
/how-to - Tutorial pages (SEO)
/about - About page (SEO)
/faq - Frequently asked questions (SEO)
```

### URL Extraction Pipeline
1. **Page Load**: Load target page with Puppeteer/Playwright
2. **Network Monitoring**: Capture all network requests for video files
3. **DOM Analysis**: Parse HTML5 video/source tags
4. **JavaScript Execution**: Wait for dynamic content to load
5. **URL Collection**: Aggregate all found video URLs
6. **Response**: Return list of direct video URLs to client

### Security Considerations
- **Rate limiting per IP**:
  - Extraction: 10 requests/minute
  - HLS Conversion: 5 requests/minute (resource intensive)
  - HLS Proxy: 30 requests/minute
  - Direct Downloads: 20 requests/minute
  - Results Viewing: 60 requests/minute
- URL validation and sanitization
- Timeout for page loading (30 seconds max)
- Memory limits for headless browser
- No execution of untrusted scripts
- SQLite for analytics only (no sensitive data)
- Regular browser instance recycling
- Rate limit headers included in responses (X-RateLimit-*)

## Known Issues & Solutions

### HLS Download Issues
- **HMAC Authentication Errors**: Some sites use time-based tokens. Use yt-dlp for better handling
- **Incomplete Downloads**: Install yt-dlp for more reliable HLS downloads
- **Conversion Failures**: Ensure ffmpeg is installed and up to date

### YouTube Extraction
- YouTube URLs are best handled with yt-dlp installed
- Falls back to HLS stream detection via Puppeteer
- Quality is detected from itag parameters in URLs
- Audio and video streams are properly merged

### Adult Site Extraction (PornHub, xVideos, xHamster)
- **HLS Audio Issues**: Many adult sites serve video and audio in separate HLS playlists
- **Solution**: Use "Convert to MP4" option which uses yt-dlp with the original page URL
- **Format Selection**: Adult sites use `best/bestvideo+bestaudio` format selector for better compatibility
- **Headers**: Proper referer headers are set automatically based on the site
- **Best Practice**: Always install yt-dlp for best results with adult sites

### Direct Video Downloads
- Direct video files (MP4, WebM, etc.) use the browser's native download functionality
- Download button automatically triggers download with proper filename
- Falls back to opening in new tab for problematic formats
- Proxy endpoint available at `/api/download/direct` for CORS-restricted videos
- Automatic referer headers for adult sites (PornHub, xVideos, xHamster)

## Cloudflare Tunnel Implementation Plan

### Overview
Implement Cloudflare Tunnel to protect server IP while bypassing the tunnel for large file downloads to improve performance and reduce bandwidth costs.

### Architecture
**Protected by Cloudflare Tunnel:**
- API endpoints (`/api/extract`, `/api/extract/[id]`)
- Metadata and small responses
- Web pages and UI assets
- Authentication and rate limiting

**Bypassing Cloudflare Tunnel (Direct Access):**
- Large video file downloads
- HLS segment downloads (.ts files)
- Converted MP4 files
- Any file > 10MB (configurable threshold)

### Implementation Status âœ…
- [x] Create architecture for split traffic routing (CF Tunnel vs direct)
- [x] Implement presigned URL system for large file downloads
- [x] Create separate subdomain/endpoint for direct file serving
- [x] Modify download endpoints to return redirect URLs instead of streams
- [x] Implement nginx configuration for direct file serving
- [x] Update client-side download logic to handle redirects
- [x] Add file size detection and routing logic

### Implemented Features
1. **Presigned URL System** (`lib/presigned-urls.ts`)
   - HMAC-based URL signing with SHA-256
   - Configurable expiration (default 1 hour)
   - Secure validation with timing attack protection
   - Metadata embedding (file path, size, referer)

2. **File Routing Logic** (`lib/file-routing.ts`)
   - Automatic routing based on file size (10MB threshold)
   - Special handling for HLS/DASH streams
   - File size estimation for remote URLs
   - Format detection utilities

3. **Updated API Endpoints**
   - `/api/download/direct` - Returns presigned URLs for large files
   - `/api/proxy/hls` - Always uses presigned URLs for HLS streams
   - `/api/convert/hls-to-mp4` - Routes based on converted file size
   - `/api/download/presigned` - Validates and serves presigned downloads

4. **Client-Side Integration** (`lib/download-client.ts`)
   - Automatic detection of response type
   - Seamless handling of both streaming and presigned URLs
   - Backwards compatibility with legacy endpoints
   - Updated HLSDownloader component

### Technical Details

#### 1. Dual-Endpoint Architecture
```
Main Domain (via CF Tunnel): app.lyricless.com
Direct Download Domain: dl.lyricless.com (bypasses tunnel)
```

#### 2. Modified API Response Structure
Instead of streaming files directly, API endpoints return metadata with presigned URLs:
```typescript
// Current: Stream file directly
return new NextResponse(stream)

// New: Return download metadata
return NextResponse.json({
  downloadUrl: generatePresignedUrl(fileInfo),
  expires: Date.now() + 3600000, // 1 hour
  size: fileSize,
  filename: suggestedFilename
})
```

#### 3. Presigned URL System
- Time-limited URLs with HMAC signatures
- Include expiry time and file metadata
- Validate on direct download server
- Prevent hotlinking and abuse

#### 4. File Size Detection Logic
```typescript
const LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB

if (fileSize > LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD) {
  return { method: 'direct', url: createDirectUrl() };
} else {
  return { method: 'tunnel', stream: fileStream };
}
```

#### 5. Nginx Configuration for Direct Server
```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name dl.lyricless.com;
  
  location /download {
    # Validate presigned URL
    # Serve file directly
    # Add proper headers for video streaming
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations
- Presigned URLs expire after 1 hour
- Include referer validation for adult sites
- Rate limit presigned URL generation
- Log all direct download requests
- Implement IP-based abuse detection
- Validate signatures server-side before serving files

### Benefits
1. **IP Protection**: Main application remains behind Cloudflare
2. **Performance**: Large files bypass CF's processing overhead
3. **Cost Savings**: Reduced Cloudflare bandwidth usage
4. **Scalability**: Can add CDN or multiple direct servers later

### Production Deployment Steps
1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   PRESIGNED_URL_SECRET=<generate-secure-random-string>
   DIRECT_DOWNLOAD_DOMAIN=dl.lyricless.com
   ```

2. **DNS Configuration**
   - Point `app.lyricless.com` to Cloudflare Tunnel
   - Point `dl.lyricless.com` directly to server IP (bypass Cloudflare)

3. **Nginx Setup**
   - Install nginx on direct download server
   - Apply configuration from `nginx-config.md`
   - Set up SSL certificates for `dl.lyricless.com`

4. **Testing**
   - Test small file downloads through tunnel
   - Test large file downloads through direct domain
   - Verify presigned URL expiration
   - Check referer validation for adult sites
