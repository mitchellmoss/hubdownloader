     // ... other verifications
   }
   ```
6. Deploy the change

### 2. Submit Your Sitemap
After verification:

   - https://lyricless.app/
   - https://lyricless.app/how-to
   - https://lyricless.app/about
   - https://lyricless.app/faq

### 4. Fix Technical Issues

Update `/app/robots.ts` to properly generate robots.txt:
```typescript
// The current implementation looks good but verify it's working
// by checking https://lyricless.app/robots.txt
```

### 5. Build Backlinks (Essential for Rankings)
